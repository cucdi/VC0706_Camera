VC0706_FTP_Client_Ethernet_MQTT 

In this project the camera (VC0706) is interfaced with wiznet w7500 and we used the FTP protocole to transfer the image file to the FTP server.
For FTP server you can use FTP FileZilla server( link: https://filezilla-project.org/). Here we used the MQTT protocol to send the image file name to th MQTT broker.
